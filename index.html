    <h2>Why The Perfect Water Bottle?</h2>

    <p>
      The Perfect Water Bottle keeps your drink cold or hot for hours,
      is built to last, and reduces the need for single-use plastic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clean design. High quality. A better choice for you and the planet.
    </p>

    <section class="heritage-story">
      <p>
        It began not as a product, but as an idea shared between a small group of
        designers, engineers, and environmental thinkers who believed that
        everyday objects should carry responsibility as well as beauty.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Perfect Water Bottle was created with a single ambition — to prove
        that sustainability and premium design could exist in the same form,
        without compromise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crafted from durable, responsibly sourced stainless steel and BPA-free
        components, every material was carefully selected for longevity and
        safety. The factories involved follow strict environmental standards,
        releasing no harmful chemicals into nature or surrounding communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        What you hold is not just a bottle, but a quiet statement — a return to
        thoughtful manufacturing, honest materials, and a future built with care
        for both people and planet.
